## About

FaceApp is a React Native application that showcases face detection capabilities. It allows users to either take a photo using their device's camera or select an image from their photo library. The app then processes the image to detect faces and displays bounding boxes around detected faces.

The project uses:

- React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- react-native-face-detection for face detection capabilities
- react-native-image-picker for camera and photo library access

This project serves as a demonstration of implementing face detection in a React Native application and can be used as a starting point for more complex face-related features.
