A React Native application that demonstrates real-time face detection capabilities using the device's camera or photo library.

## Features

- üì∏ Take photos using the device camera
- üñºÔ∏è Select images from the photo library
- üë§ Real-time face detection
- üìê Face bounding box visualization
- üì± Cross-platform (iOS & Android)

## Demo

Below is a screenshot showing the package's expected behavior. The app detects faces in a selected or captured image and draws a bounding box around the detected face(s), along with face data:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./screenshot.png" alt="Face Detection Demo" width="400" height="800"/>
</div>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- React Native development environment set up

## Permissions

```

### Android

## Installation

Install the package and its peer dependencies:

## Usage

Here is a basic example using the FaceDetector component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import { FaceDetector, ImagePickerButtons } from "react-native-face-capture";

export default function App() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState();

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <ImagePickerButtons onImagePicked={setImage} />
      <FaceDetector
        image={image}
        onDetection={(faces) => {
          console.log("Detected faces:", faces);
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## API
